- Daily limits: 30 profiles for free users, 100 for pro users

### 3. ✅ Added Rate Limiting to Profile Parser
- 2-5 second random delay before parsing any profile
- Simulates human scrolling behavior
- Daily usage tracking and limits enforced

### 4. ✅ Implemented Daily Usage Caps
- Free tier: 30 profiles per day
- Pro tier: 100 profiles per day
- Automatic reset at midnight
- Shows toast notification when limit reached

### 5. ✅ Added Random Delay Variations
- All delays use random ranges to appear more human-like
- Profile parsing: 2-5 seconds
- Search result processing: 3-7 seconds per profile
- Scrolling animations: 0.5-1.5 seconds

### 6. ✅ Backend No Longer Stores LinkedIn Data
- Removed all `save_db()` calls for profile data
- Only returns calculated scores and analysis
- No persistence of LinkedIn-derived information

### 7. ✅ Added Viewport Scrolling Simulation
- Smooth scrolling to each profile before scoring
- Random scroll positions to appear natural
- Delays after scrolling to simulate reading

### 8. ✅ Updated Manifest Permissions
- Removed `tabs` and `alarms` permissions
- Removed wildcard subdomains from host permissions
- Changed `run_at` from `document_end` to `document_idle`
- Updated description to be less LinkedIn-specific

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Rate Limiting on Profile Pages
1. Navigate to a LinkedIn profile
2. Observe the 2-5 second delay before scoring appears
3. Check console for "Waiting Xms before parsing profile..." message
4. Verify smooth scrolling animation occurs

### 2. Test Search Result Throttling
1. Navigate to LinkedIn people search
2. Verify only first 5 profiles get scored
3. Observe 3-7 second delays between each profile score
4. Check that profiles are scrolled into view before scoring

### 3. Test Daily Limits
1. Set daily limit artificially low in storage for testing
2. Try to score more profiles than the limit
3. Verify toast notification appears when limit is reached
4. Confirm no more profiles are scored after limit

### 4. Test Backend Data Storage
1. Make API calls to `/api/profiles/score` or `/api/profiles/analyze`
2. Check backend logs - should show no `save_db()` calls for profiles
3. Verify responses still include scores but no persistence

### 5. Test Extension Permissions
1. Reload extension with new manifest
2. Check chrome://extensions for permission warnings
3. Verify extension still works on LinkedIn pages
4. Confirm no access to non-LinkedIn sites

## Compliance Summary

The extension now operates in a much more compliant manner:

1. **No bulk operations** - Removed CSV export and batch processing
2. **Human-like behavior** - Added random delays and scrolling animations
3. **Rate limited** - Daily caps and delays between operations
4. **No data storage** - Backend doesn't persist LinkedIn data
5. **Minimal permissions** - Only essential permissions requested

## Remaining Risks

While significantly more compliant, the extension still:
- Parses LinkedIn DOM (individual profiles only, with delays)
- Scores profiles based on extracted data
- Generates messages using profile information

These are core features that provide value but still technically violate LinkedIn's TOS regarding browser plugins that scrape data. The mitigations reduce detection risk but don't eliminate the fundamental TOS conflict.

## Recommendation

For a fully compliant version, consider:
1. Manual input mode where users paste profile text
2. Focus on resume optimization and interview prep
3. Partner with LinkedIn through official APIs
4. Pivot to a different professional networking platform
